You never think to occupy my time

And you never require

And you never lean too much

And it's always been this way

It's wearing thin

Your words come crowdin' in

And I want you to know

It's the stuff that stirs me up

And follows me away

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong

I'm willing, I'm willing

I will lead you on

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong

Never think to occupy my time

And you never require

And you never lean too much

And it's always been this way

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong

I'm willing, I'm willing

I will lead you on

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong

I'm willing, I'm willing

I will lead you on

So write my name

And carry my picture

There's nothing wrong
