title: Hey You
description: The Connells - Ring

Standing back before the angels get to me,

Well it seems such a sorry waste of time.

Holding back on these who want the best for me.

I guess I can't be blamed for trying.

It's really very funny how it wears me down,

Waiting for that something.

Hey you, well I'm sorry but it's time to let you know.

Hey you, and it's sounds a bit like preaching.

I'd bend over backwards to let you know.

Rolling back around the numbers on the wall,

Well it's sad 'cause I don't have much to show.

Standing back before the angels get to me,

Well it seems the better way to go.
