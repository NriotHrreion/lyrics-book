title: Running Mary
description: The Connells - Ring

I was running Mary.
And the days were growing long.
And I was minding mine,
I was doing nothing wrong.
And the news you sent me.
And the bar's upon the door.
And this one caught me blind --
Couldn't stop me anymore.
Tell me how much do I forgive
'Cause you laid one in on me, but I'm all right.
Tell me how much -- this goes on and on.
I was running barely
And it's hard to face me more.
And I was minding mine,
And doing nothing more.
