Sometimes I get the feeling things won't fall apart

Sometimes I think it's gone too far

Sometimes I have the feeling things seem pretty nice

Then again sometimes I'd like to leave you twice

Once we decide upon it

We won't fall apart

This time I think it's gone too far

And you get where you can't decide

Don't ask any other

And you get where you can't decide

Didn't I say "Sorry"

Didn't I say "Dear"

Didn't I consider

Didn't I stand clear

Didn't you say "New boy get down on your knees"

Didn't I say "Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying"

Didn't I say "Sorry"

Didn't I say "Dear"

Didn't I consider

Didn't I stand clear

Didn't you say "New boy get down on your knees"

Didn't I say "Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying"

Didn't I say "Sorry"

Didn't I say "No"

Didn't you consider

Didn't I let it go

Didn't you say "New boy get down on the floor"

Didn't I say "Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying"

Didn't I say "Sorry"

Didn't I say "Slow"

Didn't you consider

Didn't you say "No"

Didn't you say something,that something I said

Didn't I say "Trying, I'm trying, I'm trying"

Didn't I say "Sorry"

Didn't I say "Yes"

Didn't you consider

Didn't I confessed

Didn't you say "New boy get down on your knees"

Didn't I say "Maybe I'm trying, I'm trying"

Sometimes I get this feeling things won't fall apart

Then again sometimes I think it's gone too far
