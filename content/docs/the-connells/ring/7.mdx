Come steer me now

Leave ideas in my head.

And I'll come alive

Or cover me instead.

There's a ceiling light above me

And a song that says I will.

And it's kneeling down upon me -- lonelier still.

Come hear me out.

There's more that I have been

Than figured out

And stunted end to end.

There's a ceiling light above me

And a space it cannot fill.

And it's bearing down upon me holding me still.

And I convinced you

That I would get there first.

And you send me down a spiral -- only worse.
