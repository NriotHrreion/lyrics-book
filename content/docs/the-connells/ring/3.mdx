Got no reason for coming to me and the rain running down

There's no reason

And the same voice coming to me like it's all slowing down

And believe me --

I was the one who let you know

I was sorry-ever-after. '74-'75

It's not easy, nothing to say 'cause it's already said

It's never easy

When I look on your eyes then I find that I'll do fine

When I look on your eyes then I'll do better

I was the one who let you know

I was sorry-ever-after. '74-'75

Giving me more and I'll defy

'Cause you're really only after '74-'75

Got no reason for coming to me and the rain running down

There's no reason

When I look on your eyes then I find that I'll do fine

When I look on your eyes then I'll do better

I was the one who let you know

I was sorry-ever-after. '74-'75

Giving me more and I'll defy

'Cause you're really only after '74-'75

I was the one who let you know

I was sorry-ever-after. '74-'75

Giving me more and I'll defy

'Cause you're really only after '74-'75
