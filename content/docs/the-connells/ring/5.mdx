You're thinking everybody needs to know

What sets you so far apart.

On a hunch I think I could show

But we'll let you keep the part.

You gotta pull it off

When we least expect it.

Really need to see your fact on the wall

Of a three or four star restaurant.

Shouldn't take more than a call

You always seem to get what you want.

Gotta full it off

When we least expect it.

Gotta pull it off...

Then we'll find out

What this is really all about.

Then I'll be the one who says "I don't believe it."

Then we'll find you

Like you'd always want us to,

Face first in your own favorite way.
