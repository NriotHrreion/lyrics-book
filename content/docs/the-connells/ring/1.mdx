Someone tells me something

Well i'm prepared to listen

Nothing's going on, nothin's going on

Standing next to no one

Well that was my intention

Nothing's going on, nothin's going on

But then you're back and i'm guessing it's not so bad at all

But then you're back and i'm guessing it's not so bad at all

And i've been standing slackjawed since you were here

Something says this may be the strangest light i'll mention

Someone left you on, someone left you on

Saying next to nothing

the words were my invention

Someone left you on, someone left you on

And now you're here and i'm thinking it's not so bad at all

And now you're here and i'm thinking it's not so bad at all

And i've been standing slackjawed since you were here

Yeah, and I'm waiting for you

I've been standing slackjawed

Someone tells me something

Well I'm prepared to listen

Nothings going on, nothings going on

But then you're back and I'm guessing it's not so bad at all

But then you're back and I'm guessing it's not so bad at all

And I've been standing slackjawed since you were here

Yeah, and I'm waiting for you

And I've been standing slackjawed since you were here

Yeah, and I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for you

I've been standing slackjawed
