And once said "please, some more"

And not even now and then.

Some place I know you swore

That you'd never go again.

I had this feeling once

That nothing was out of touch.

I found some comfort there

But that doesn't matter much.

And did we start digging around?

And did we start dragging around?

Be my burden

Christ, I'm certain I'm already bound.

I'm not ever quite together

I'm not sorted out.

You talked to me some more

And that was worth waiting for.

Sometimes I can't decide

If we're even half alive.
