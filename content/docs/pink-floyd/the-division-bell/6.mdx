title: Wearing the Inside Out
description: Pink Floyd - The Division Bell

From morning to night I stayed out of sight

Didn't recognize I'd become

No more than alive, I'd barely survive

In a word, overrun



Won't hear a sound (he's curled into the corner)

From my mouth (but still the screen is flickering)

I've spent too long (with an endless stream of garbage to)

On the inside out (curse the place)

My skin is cold (in a sea of random images)

To the human touch (the self-destructing animal)

This bleeding heart's (waiting for the waves to break)

Not beating much



I murmured a vow of silence and now

I don't even hear when I think aloud

Extinguished by light, I turn on the night

Wear its darkness with an empty smile



I'm creeping back to life

My nervous system all awry

I'm wearing the inside out



Look at him now

He's paler somehow

But he's coming around

He's starting to choke

It's been so long since he spoke

Well, he can have the words right from my mouth



And with these words I can see

Clear through the clouds that covered me

Just give it time then speak my name

Now we can hear ourselves again



I'm holding out (he's standing on the threshold)

For the day (caught in fiery anger)

When all the clouds (and hurled into the furnace)

Have blown away (he'll curse the place)

I'm with you now (he's torn in all directions)

Can speak your name (and still the screen is flickering)

Now we can hear (waiting for the flames to break)

Ourselves again
