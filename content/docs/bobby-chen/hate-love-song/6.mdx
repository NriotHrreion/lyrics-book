Lyrics：Dino<br />Music：陈升<br /><br />REMEMBER THE DAY WE CAME BACK FROM THE PARK ;<br />YOU STOOD THERE, COVERED WITH ICE CRYING IN THE DARK,<br />DRIED YOUR EYES, TURNED TO ME AND SPOKE ;<br />YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY,FELT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS A JOKE.<br /><br />YOU SAID YOU OFTEN FEEL SO PAINFUL, SO COLD ;<br />EVEN WHEN YOU HIDE YOURSELF IN THE BLACK COAT.<br /><br />ALL YOUR DREAMS ARE EMPTY,YOU HAVEN'T NO PRIDE ;<br />SO YOU GET DRUNK EVERYNIGHT,<br />TO FIGHT THE PAIN YOU FEAR DEEP INSIDE.<br />SO I CRY IN MY HEART FOR THE FREEDOM IT LONGS ;<br />PAINTS A FANTASY FOR ME<br />THROUGH THESE SILLY LOVE SONGS.<br /><br />ON THIS NEW STREET CORNER, AS I STAND ALL ALONE,<br />MY LIFE'S NOT WORTH LIVING, TURNS MY HEART INTO STONE.<br /><br />AS I LIE AWAKE IN BED, NIGHTMARES HAUNTING ME ;<br />BREAK AWAY FROM THESE CHAINS<br />TO ESCAPE REALITY.SUICIDE CALLS MY NAME,<br />LIKE IT HAS IN THE PAST ;LET ME SLEEP ON FOREVER,<br />PRAY MY NEW DREAMS WILL LAST.
